# (Project: Oil production and consumption: regional and per capita investigation - [Gapminder World] )
## by (Mohamed Lamouchi)


## Dataset

Gapmindezr world is sweedish website creted to fight misconception by providing and collecting releable statistics helping to use facts to understand the world here. We have choose in this report to work with:

-Total oil production. :The total amouint of crude oil (tonne oil equivalent)

-total oil consumption :he total amount of crude oil consumption(tonne oil equivalent)

-Oil consumption per person (tonne per year per person)

-Oil poduction per person (tonne per person)

-Coutries with region sub regions table here

-Income per person (GDP per capita): gross domestic per person adjusted for difference in purshasing power(in internatoional dollars)



## Conclusions

        general increase trend in overall oil production and consumption since the the 60's but marked by around 1979 and then a crush as price collaspse tha episode is know by "1980s oil glut".And ezven the consumption grow, the production also follow as new technologies emerged like Shale oil.

        strong correlation of education with GDP per capita and between oil production per capita and oil consumption per caoita . We can see clearly that the oil was the main drive of econolmic growth.


## Limitations

        The amount of oil production doesn't mention the origin of oil, onshore fiels, offshore condenstae or shale oil, and the data abd thus cannot do furthur investigation

        Gas production and consumption was not available as i wouil had offered a much broader picture on fossil ennergy.

        Even if there is a clear relationship betwwen GDP per capita and oil productioon and consupmtion per capita, other energies forms like coal, wind solar would have drawn a broader picture and give us an idea of ennergies transition

        Beside GDP we may need another metrics to measure the wellbeing and livebility like for example the human developement index
